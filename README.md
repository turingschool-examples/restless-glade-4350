User Story 1, Doctors Show Page

As a visitor
When I visit a doctor's show page
I see all of that doctor's information including:
 - name
 - specialty
 - university where they got their doctorate
And I see the name of the hospital where this doctor works
And I see the names of all of the patients this doctor has
```
​
```
User Story 2, Remove a Patient from a Doctor
​
As a visitor
When I visit a Doctor's show page
Then next to each patient's name, I see a button to remove that patient from that doctor's caseload
When I click that button for one patient
I'm brought back to the Doctor's show page
And I no longer see that patient's name listed
And when I visit a different doctor's show page that is caring for the same patient,
Then I see that the patient is still on the other doctor's caseload
```

```

As a visitor
When I visit the patient index page
